We play in a shuffle board league every Tuesday.  
Our team name is Naked and Extra Crispy (A shout-out to how we like our wings).  
The team motto is "Slam them."  
It works in every situation.  
So, I thought we could use a soundboard.

Check it out [here](http://slam.makoncline.com).

I made this as part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.
