excerpt: "A soundboard for slamming them."

We play in a shuffle board league every Tuesday. 

Our team name is Naked and Extra Crispy (A shoutout to how we like our wings).

The team motto is "Slam them."

It works in every situation.

So, I thought we could use a soundboard.

I made this as part of the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge.
